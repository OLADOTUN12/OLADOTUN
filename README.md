# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Oladotun

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!  
This repository documents my **hands-on SOC lab projects**, **SIEM configurations**, and **security monitoring experiments** using open-source tools like **Wazuh**, **Suricata**, and **Kali Linux**.  
It serves as a collection of my practical learning journey toward mastering **threat detection, log analysis, and incident response**.

## About Me
I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about **defensive security**, **SIEM engineering**, and **blue team operations**.  
I build and manage **virtual SOC environments** that simulate real-world monitoring using **Wazuh, Suricata, and Windows agents**.

**Current Focus:**  
`SOC Lab Setup | Wazuh | Suricata | Log Analysis | Active Directory Security`

**Goal:**  
To become proficient in **SOC analysis, incident response, and security automation** using open-source tools.
